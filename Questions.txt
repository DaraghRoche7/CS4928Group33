-How does the Observer pattern improve decoupling in the Café POS system?
    Now the Order class does not have to know about the different observer classes.
    so if we want to add new observers it's easier.
- Why is it beneficial that new observers can be added without modifying the Order class?
    More flexibility and it is easier to add or manipulate observers in the future
-Can you think of a real-world system (outside cafés) where Observer is used (e.g., push notifications, GUIs)
	When any button on a gui is clicked then it's the subject, event listeners on the button are observers, when the buttons clicked listeners get told.
